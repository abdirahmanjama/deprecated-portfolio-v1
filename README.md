## Forking this repo

Many people have contacted me on <a href="https://instagram.com/abdirahmancodes" target="_blank">Instagram</a> asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is **no**.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/) and [Chakra docs](https://chakra-ui.com/).


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Info

This project was created so I could experiment with different technologies in an environment outside production. If there's a particular technology I am interested in I will try it on this project. 

## Future work

- Add an About Me section
- Implement the Blog section
- Experiment with Chakra UI's colour theme by extending it and fully customising it 
- Auto-generated CI/CD pipelines?
- Refactor code 
- Fix styling bugs
